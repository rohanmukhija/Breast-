# Breast-cancer-Classification
  
It is an application for classification of Breast Cancer using Classification Tree Algorithm approach.
The classification is based upon mathematical analysis of Dataset (source - Kaggle).
The application has been developed on C++ from scratch.


#Introduction:

Breast cancer has become the second important cause of cancer deaths in women today
world. It is the most common type of cancer today found in the women today .Decision tree
is a most important technique in the medical field.
Breast Cancer Diagnosis are two medical applications which became a big challenge to the
researchers. The use of machine learning and data mining techniques has changed the
whole process of breast cancer Diagnosis. Breast Cancer Diagnosis using machine learning
technique distinguishes benign from malignant breast lumps. These two problems are
mainly in the scope of the classification problems.
We have implemented Decision tree algorithm from scratch in C++ and used dataset
available on Kaggle to train the model.

#Algorithm used:

The Decision trees algorithm consists of two parts: nodes and rules (tests). We construct the
tree. In which each node reflect a test on an attribute the basic idea of this algorithm is to
draw a flowchart diagram that contains a root node on top. All other (non-leaf) nodes
represent a test until you reach a leaf node (final result).
Decision tree algorithms have been widely used in data mining applications below are some
important reasons that why decision trees are used in the area of data mining and
classification: Decision trees create user-friendly rules. They are considered one of easy to
understand algorithms to the end user in Data mining.
They show effective association among the dataset attributes and represent in an easy-to
understand form. Decision trees provide a clear indication of important attributes. Decision
trees require less computation. They require less computation compared to other
classification algorithms.
